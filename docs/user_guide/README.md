## Getting Started

The Numerical Analysis App is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. When you first open the app, you'll be greeted with a splash screen followed by an onboarding tutorial that introduces the main features of the application.

After completing the onboarding, you'll be taken to the home screen where you can select between different chapters of numerical methods.

## App Navigation

The application is organized into chapters:

- **Chapter 1**: Root Finding Methods
- **Chapter 2**: Linear Algebra Methods

Each chapter contains multiple numerical methods that you can explore and use.

## Root Finding Methods

Chapter 1 includes the following root finding methods:

1. **Bisection Method**: Find roots by repeatedly dividing intervals in half.
2. **False Position Method**: An improved version of the bisection method using linear interpolation.
3. **Simple Fixed Point Method**: Find roots through iterative function application.
4. **Newton Method**: Use function derivatives to find increasingly accurate approximations.
5. **Secant Method**: A variation of Newton's method that approximates derivatives using two points.

For each method, you can:
- Enter a function or equation
- Set parameters specific to that method
- View step-by-step solutions
- See graphical representations of the solution process

## Linear Algebra Methods

Chapter 2 includes the following linear algebra methods:

1. **Gauss Elimination Method**: Solve systems of linear equations by converting to row echelon form.
2. **LU Decomposition Method**: Factorize a matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices.
3. **Gauss Jordan Method**: An extension of Gauss Elimination that continues to reduced row echelon form.
4. **Cramer Method**: Use determinants to solve systems of linear equations.

For each method, you can:
- Input matrices and vectors
- View the solution process step by step
- See detailed mathematical explanations

## Customizing Settings

The app offers customization options including:

- **Dark/Light Theme**: Switch between dark and light mode for comfortable viewing in different lighting conditions.
- **Decimal Places**: Adjust the number of decimal places shown in results for more precise or simplified viewing.
